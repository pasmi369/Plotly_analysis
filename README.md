# Project overview:
- A dashboard has been designed using the data from the samples of some individuals to find the type and quantity of the bacterias found in the their belly buttons.
- By using HTML/CSS, Javascript, Plotly and D3.json() libraries, I have created a dashboard to present the top 10 bateria cultures found in a participant's belly button and their weekly washing freqency.

# Summary:
- The dashboard displays the respective informations about an individual as per their "id", which can be selected from the dropdown menu:
  - ### Below are few examples with different ID's selection:
